						   <p class="about-para-w3ls">ISKCON Amravatiâ€™s inauguration was done by His Holiness Lokanath Swami and the most beautiful deities of Shri Shri Rukmini Dwarakadish were installed on 19th Nov 2000. It has a big temple hall with photos that depicts pastimes of Lord Krishna
and at the back side of temple there are residential quarters for devotees. Also there is guest room for the accommodation of the guests.Amaravati city has a special connection with Lord Krishna because it is just 44 kilometres from Kuandanyapur Dham which is the birth place of Srimati Rukmini Devi.

                    <h2><span><b>History</b></span> <br> of ISKCON Temple
                    </h2>
                    <p class="about-para-w3ls1">ISKCON was founded by Abhaya Caranaravinda Bhaktivedanta Swami (born Abhay Charan De) in New York City, USA, in the year 1966. He is considered as the spiritual guru 
					of the organization. ISKCON was founded with the objective of encouraging the practice of Bhakti Yoga or Krishna Consciousness. The members of ISKCON dedicate 
					their words and deeds towards pleasing Lord Krishna, whom they consider to be the Supreme One. <br>
					In the last 53 years, the organization has opened hundreds of temples, centers, and rural communities across the world. ISKCON has also established over a hundred 
					vegetarian restaurants, several local meeting groups, and a number of community projects including free food distribution programs (Food for Life Project) and eco-villages, 
					to mention a few. They have also founded a scientific research branch in 1976, named Bhaktivedanta Institute (BI), which encourages the study of the origin of life and nature by making use of Vedic insights.</p>

			<h2 style="center">Core beliefs of ISKCON</h2>
			<p class="about-para-w3ls">The members of ISKCON follow the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition, a Vaishnava religious movement that has been prevalent in India since the latter part of the 15thcentury.  ISKCON followers form the largest branch of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. Bhaktivedanta Swami took this tradition to the Western world and spread it through his write-ups and translations of Hindu Holy Scriptures like the Srimad Bhagavatam, Bhagavad Gita, and Chaitanya Charitamrita among others. These works are now regarded as the scriptures of ISKCON and are available in many languages.

The ISKCON theology upholds Lord Krishna as the ultimate God and the source of all avatars of the Almighty. Radha is regarded as the female counterpart of Krishna and the epitome of divine love.
