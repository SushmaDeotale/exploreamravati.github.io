						   <p class="about-para-w3ls">This is one of the most popular bhajans (holy song) of  Great saint Tukdoji Maharaj.

The name of this great man was Manik and father’s name Namdeo. He was born (1909) in Ingle family  (surname).  His father was a very poor tailor. He was never interested in taking the education, instead he would like to sit with the people in temples and sing the songs. He learned the art of playing “khanjiri”  (an instrument of about 6 inches diameter with the diaphragm of thin animal skin, played by one of the palms and held in other).  Manik  accepted the great saint of Varkhed Shri Adkoji Maharaj as his Guru. Manik would amuse the people by singing his own instant compositions on the rhythm of khanjiri.

                    <h2><span><b>History</b></span> <br> of Ambadevi Temple
                    </h2>
                    <p class="about-para-w3ls1">The construction date of the Ambadevi temple is unknown, with a prevalent legend that the temple structure dates back to Lord Krishna era. Krishna is believed to have married Rukmini in this temple, after eloping with her. Goddess Amba is worshiped with great admiration by the people of the Hindu community. Each year devotees come to visit this temple from all parts of India, especially during the Navratri season. More than two lakh worshipers pay visit during this time. The people of Amravati conduct a mandatory puja of Goddess Amba before marriage or any other auspicious ceremony of the 
					house. The Garbhagriha is split into three main arches with a sandstone idol of Goddess Ambabai, Lord Ganpati, Lord Mahadev, Lord Vishnu and Goddess Parvati. In the main chamber, one can see the huge idol of Goddess Amba with Lakshmi and Narayan. The Western wall of Garbhagriha has idols and engravings of various gods and goddesses.

Ambadevi temple is a sight to behold during the Navratri festival as it remains decorated with beautiful lights.</p>

			<h2 style="center">The Temple Complex</h2>
			<p class="about-para-w3ls">The Ambadevi temple complex is surrounded with high walls and on entering the compound, one can find a huge spacious hall. The left side leads to the courtyard through a number of corridors. The main gates are huge with the look of a fort gate. Above the gate, there is a small chamber also known as the “Nagarkhana” or the drum room. The temple walls are full with pictorial depiction of the Puranas.
The Ambadevi Temple
The main “Garbagriha” or the “Gabharas” is broken into three large arch shaped rooms with sandstone idols of Goddess Ambabai, Lord Ganapati, Lord Mahadev, Lord Vishnu and Goddess Parvati. The central chamber is where Goddess Amba resides with Lakshmi and Narayan. Two silver lamps are seen burning in front of the deities for 24 hours and 365 days. The western wall of the temple complex has idols and engravings of various Gods and Goddesses. The age of these idols are uncertain. They are engraved with such detail that they almost look like machine cut. It is still a mystery about the creation of the temple plaster work and ornaments of the deities.
